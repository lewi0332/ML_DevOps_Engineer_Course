## Project Introduction

In this project, you will implement you learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The completed project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

This project will give you practice using your skills for testing, logging, and best coding practices from this lesson. It will also introduce you to a problem data scientists across companies face all the time. How do we identify (and later intervene with) customers who are likely to churn?

Below are the first few rows associated with the dataset for this project, which was pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/code).

## Objectiv

This is a project to implement best coding Practices. You will not need to code for this project entirely from scratch. 

We have already provided you the *churn_notebook.ipynb* file containing the solution to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn, but without implementing the engineering and softeware best practices. 

you will need to refactor the giben **churn_notbook.ipynb** file following the best coding practices to generate these files: 

1. churn_library.py
2. churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
3. README.md

## Starter Files

Here is the structure available to you in the workspace next

└── models               # Store models
```

The Guide.ipynb and churn_notebook.ipynb will be your starting point for the project.

## High-Level Instructions

These are the three files you will need to complete after refactoring the churn_notebook.ipynb file:

1. churn_library.py
    The churn_library.py is a library of functions to find customers who are likely to churn. You may be able to complete this project by completing each of these functions, but you also have the flexibility to change or add functions to meet the rubric criteria.

    The document strings have already been created for all the functions in the churn_library.py to assist with one potential solution. In addition, for a better understanding of the function call, see the **Sequence diagram** on the next page.

    After you have defined all functions in the churn_library.py, you may choose to add an `if __name__ == "__main__"` block that allows you to run the code below and understand the results for each of the functions and refactored code associated with the original notebook.

```
python churn_library.py
```

2. **churn_script_logging_and_tests.py**

This file should:
- Contain unit tests for the *churn_library.py* functions. You have to write test for each input function. Use the basic assert statements that test functions work properly. The goal of test functions is to checking the returned items aren't empty or folders where results should land have results after the function has been run.
- Log any errors and INFO messages. You should log the info messages and errors in a .log file, so it can be viewed post the run of the script. The log messages should easily be understood and traceable.

Also, ensure that testing and logging can be completed on the command line, meaning, running the below code in the terminal should test each of the functions and provide any errors to a file stored in the /logs folder.

```
ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
```

> ***Testing framework:*** *As long as you fulfil all the rubric criteria, the choice of testing framework rests with the student. For instance, you can use pytest for writing functional tests.*


3. **README.md**
   
This file will provide an overview of the project, the instructions to use the code, for example, it explains how to test and log the result of each function. For instance, you can have the following detailed sections in the README.md file:
- Project description
- Files and data description
- Running the files

## Code Quality Considerations

- **Style Guide** - Format your refactored code using [PEP 8 – Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Running the command below can assist with formatting. To assist with meeting pep 8 guidelines, use `autopep8` via the command line commands below:

```
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive churn_library.py
```

- **Style Checking and Error Spotting** - Use [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) for the code analysis looking for programming errors, and scope for further refactoring. You should check the pylint score using the command below.

```
pylint churn_library.py
pylint churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
```

You should make sure you don't have any errors, and that your code is scoring as high as you can get it! Shoot for a `pylint` score exceeding 7 for both Python files.

- **Docstring** - All functions and files should have document strings that correctly identifies the inputs, outputs, and purpose of the function. All files have a document string that identifies the purpose of the file, the author, and the date the file was created.

## Rubric

> **<span style="color:red">Important</span>**
> 
> It is good to have a quick look at the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/3094/view) before you start refactoring the code. The rubric defines the criteria against which Reviewers will evaluate your submission. In other words, it has details on what is needed for a successful solution.

## Final Expectation

The project requires completed versions of these files:

1. churn_library.py
2. churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
3. README.md

The file structure of a completed project should be similar to the below:

![a `data` dir, `images` (with `eda` and `results` subdirectories), and `models`; then the churn_notebook.ipynb file, churn_library.py, churn_script_logging_and_tests.py file, and a README file.](./images/clean-code-churn-files.png)*Project File Structure*

## Submission

You can submit through either of the options below:

- [Preferred] SUBMIT PROJECT button in the workspace will automatically zip all file in the workspace directory and submit to the reviewers.

- SUBMIT PROJECT button on the last page will prompt you to provide a Github link to your completed project.

Both of the options above will send a submission acknowledgement to your mailbox.**

## Project

The code in churn_library.py should complete data science solution process including:

- EDA
- Feature Engineering (including encoding of categorical variables)
- Model Training
- Prediction
- Model Evaluation

Refer to the **Save Images & Models** and P**roblem Solving** sections in the rubric for the specific expectations.

The sequence diagram below shows the sequence of churn_library.py function calls, and the Document Strings section further shows each function's input/output details.
